The application in my example is an embedded program, coded in C, that controls the movements of a robot. The code can be linted on pushes to feature branches with clang-format or clang-tidy. Unit tests can be written in plain C, or with help of a dedicated unit testing framework like the assert based Unity. Building of the C code is done with a linux machine and GCC, and GNU make/makefiles is used to build different versions of the software. The CI can be connected to physical testing hardware, so the code can be constantly built, flashed on the actual microcontroller and tested in real life scenarios. The hardware test result can be obtained from E.g. programmable measurement devices like oscilloscopes with Python, Lua or similar. Besides Jenkins and GitHub Actions, the CI can also be set up with GitLab, Bitbucket Pipelines, Bamboo or Travis CI. I think the setup would work better in a self-hosted environment since the cloud-based option could be too costly for a team of around 6 people. Self-hosted CI probably also gives more freedom to customize the pipeline and makes it easier to integrate the hardware tests into the CI. Usefulness of a cloud-based solution would depend on it's price, ease of use, security and scalability.
